## Packages Installed

### axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. It's commonly used for making AJAX requests and handling responses in web applications.

### react-router-dom

React Router DOM provides routing capabilities to React applications. It allows you to define dynamic routes and navigate between different components/pages in a React application.

### redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It provides a centralized store for managing the state of your application, making it easier to manage and update application state in large-scale React applications.

### redux-devtools-extension

Redux DevTools Extension is a browser extension that provides advanced debugging and monitoring capabilities for Redux applications. It allows you to inspect and debug Redux state changes, actions, and dispatched events in real-time.

### react-redux

React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It provides bindings to connect Redux state and actions to React components, making it easier to integrate Redux with React applications.

### redux-thunk

Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write asynchronous logic inside action creators. It enables you to dispatch asynchronous actions, such as making API requests, and handle asynchronous logic before dispatching actions to the Redux store.
